## 1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I think Assignment1 has really helped me be able to apply the skills and code I learned this past semester into an actual project. Labs are different from Assignments since for labs, they are more of a collective work and the students are working one-on-one with the professor. This Assignment allowed me to be more "independent" and use what I have learned to make my e-commerce site. With labs however, I tend to follow everything the professor has so it is hard to play around and become familiar with the tools I am using till now. 

## 2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

I want to be able to become more comfortable and familiarizing with code in JS files. When I opened Assignment 1 and went into the server.js, I got a bit worried since I do not know exactly what they all mean. The comments do help, but I still ask fellow peers if they could explain certain questions and help me implement my project. 

## 3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

Yes! The WODs have allowed me the chance to explain my code verbally. I think this is a good strategy in learning and understanding the code because (from what I've read), being able to explain how you have done something helps with memory. The more senses that gets invovled with memory making, the more better you can remember something. The WODs we've done are also similiar to our Assignments, so that was very helpful!

## 4. The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

I did not have full confidence in myself when I was working on my labs for ITM352. Once a while, there would be question that causes me to stumble and ask classmates. They are not too hard to do and the professor is able to record what information was missed. In addition, the labs provide LOTS of information to people from a variety of majors. 

## 5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

Assignment1 was quite an eye-opener for me. It made me realize how much time it needed to finish. Time management was one of my biggest challanges, so it was difficult for me to be able to submit it on time, without rushing to add some last minute code. 

## 6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

I believe that in order for our classes to be improved, we have an in-class work day. We can work with peers to help each other out. However, I know that everyone is constantly busy, and it can be lacking if not a lot attend events. 

## 7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

My favorite resource from the class are the screencasts. With the screencasts, I am able to replay certain parts multiple times to get the instructions correct. It is a good way to receive reassurance and know that we are not bothering our parents.
