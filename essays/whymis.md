Prior to college, I never thought about majoring in Management Information Systems because I initially applied to UH Manoa as a Public Health major. I wanted to work in healthcare. But over ths summer before college, I did some research about non-clinical healthcare careers and discovered health data analytics. I had a slight interest in technology, but since I was so unfamiliar with it, I decided to challenge myself to pursue something new. I specifically chose MIS over Computer Science because the coursework for MIS also includes classes within the Shidler College of Business. I believe that the business classes I take would help me better understand how the market and operations work.
